		// This method will merge all registered merge candidates into a new index session and will also output all

		// and input codecs.
		//

                // - Trinity::pack_terms() to build the terms files and then persist them
                // - Trinity::persist_segment() to persist the actual index
		//
		// IMPORTANT:
		// You will need to consider all candidates after merge() has returned:
		// If a source's `gen` is higher than 1+ other index sources that are NOT included in this merge session as a candidate
		// 	then you may delete the candidate's index and other files/data but you MUST retain its masked documents, because
		// 	there are more sources, not included in this merge session, with lower gen that we will need to mask documents from them that
		// 	have potentially been updated/deleted/masked by the source.
		// Otherwise, you may safely wipe all data related to that merge candidate.
		//
		// When merge() returns and you consider all candidates, you should probably consider all other index sources/segments that didn't participate
		// in the merge session, and if their gen is lower than any other remaining index source/segment that has any index data(i.e not retained for
		// its masked products only), then you can wipe that source/segments remaining data as well.
		//
		// You are expected to outIndexSess->begin() before you merge(), and outIndexSess->end() afterwards, though you may
		// want to use Trinity::persist_segment(outIndexSess) which will persist and invoke end() for you
